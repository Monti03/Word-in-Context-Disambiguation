In order to test the model with the LSTM you have only to change the import of the 
build_model function into:

    from stud.implementation_rnn import build_model

The files that are in this folder are the several model that I tested:
- NLP-HW1-First-Method.ipynb is the file in which I trained the first model
- NLP-HW1-First-Method-Fasttext.ipynb is the file in which I trained the first model with the fasttext emebdding as extra
- NLP-HW1-First-Method-New-Dataset.ipynb is the file in which I trained the first model over a new dataset as extra

- NLP-HW1-Second-Method.ipynb is the file in which I trained the second (the one with the LSTM) model
- NLP-HW1-Second-Method-Fasttext.ipynb is the file in which I trained the second (the one with the LSTM) model with the fasttext emebdding as extra
- NLP-HW1-Second-Method-New-Dataset.ipynb is the file in which I trained the second (the one with the LSTM) model over a new dataset as extra

The report is present in this folder and also in the root folder
